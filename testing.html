				<h2>Testing Tasks</h2>
				<p>There were several test tasks to test the team registration task.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Apply for team just as yourself</li>
					<li>Apply with 1 or more teammates for an incomplete</li>
					<li>Apply for full team registration</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Testing Observations and Results</h2>
				<p>
					The participant was able to quickly identify the register page button and go to the page. The participant completed the first two tasks quickly with no hesitations, however, 
					the third task took longer and user identified mistake was made therefore had to read FAQ. Furthermore, the participant also tried error handling 
					during the test to see how the system will react.
				</p>
				<p>
					The user interface was not understood and the user committed a mistake. The system automatically adds it's email into
					the team without needing the user to add its own teammate and you are only required to add teammate's email address.
				</p>
				<h2>Testing questions and feedback</h2>
				<p>
					The participant told me that adding the email address already was not intuitive. While the FAQ is visible, a visual indication should be shown to the user
					instead of doing it behind the scenes. The participant suggested including the email entry already when a user enters the registration page.
					The participant also suggested that more scenarios be added to the team registration submission such as checking if team name already is taken and if the added
					teammate email address is not already in a team or have registered. The participant said having FAQ as progressive disclosure because the registration should be easy
					enough without needing it. The feedback messages were said to be bland because it is using the default javascript alert function making the text too small and
					difficult to view.
				</p>
				<p>
					The positives from the website is that the colour scheme was nicely done and the website was aesthetic. The registration page was easy to navigate and if there was
					a visual cue that email is currently added to the form, the team registration process is easy and intuitive.
				</p>
				<h2>Changes</h2>
				<p>After the testing, several changes were made. From the feedback from the participant, positive features were also retained.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Visual indication to show the accounts email address is already added to the team registration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Custom feedback message container box which is more visually appealing and is centred in the page.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some changes were not made because of time constraints</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Checking for more scenarios during team registration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Putting FAQ as progressive disclosure.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Follow up test</h2>
				<p>
					The participant completed the tasks quickly with no errors. Because the email address was added to the table, it provided the visual cue hence the task was said
					to be more intuitive and easier because the user didn't have to read FAQ to complete the form.
