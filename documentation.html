			<img src="image/hta.png" alt="hta diagram" />
			<h2>Footnotes</h2>
			<p>"Player registers to SQRL" means a player registers himself/herself for a team or with other team members in an incomplete team registration or a full team registration.</p>
			<p>The HTA didn't include cancel and removing team members as it's not related to the main flow of the task of registering a team and it complicates the diagram by adding more conditional statements.</p>

			<h1 class="wizard-font-large">Colour Scheme</h1>
			<p>I used two colours from the adjacent/analogous colour scheme, red being the primary and yellow
			as the secondary colour in the website. Only two colours were used to avoid having too many colours.
			I chose red and yellow because both are warm colours which creates the feeling of excitement and movement which links to the active sport of Quidditch.
			It also provides good contrast, colour balance and is pleasing to the eye. The colour scheme is also inspired by Gryffindor
			from Harry Potter to connect to the Wizarding World in UK</p>
			<p>To provide visual feedback for actions, I chose a monochromatic colour scheme for red and yellow during an event such as hover or
			being active. This was done because having monochromatic colours avoids having too many colours but also
			is distinguishable to the users during an event.</p>
			<p>White and black text is used to contrast the background colours. I chose a white background with the analogous colour scheme because it has minimalistic design and white background
			with black text is more readable.</p>
			<img src="image/colour_scheme.png" alt="Colour Scheme photo" />
			<h3>Main Colours</h3>
			<p>#CA171C - Primary colour of the website. Creates feeling of excitement and movement.
			Used for the header, footer and popup messages. Also used for headings</p>
			<p>#FCCE14 - Secondary colour of the website. Provides contrast to #CA171C.
			Used in table headings and components in the body content. Hover colour in the header and footer links</p>
			<h3>Other colours</h3>
			<p>#d44548 - Same hue to #CA171C. Used for button hovers. Provides feedback while retaining contrast
			to button text</p>
			<p>#FEF1BF - Same hue to #FCCE15. Used for table row hovers. Provides feedback to user which row
			is currently hovered over. Retains contrast with table text and provides contrast with table heading</p>
			<p>#FDDE61 - Same hue to #FCCE15. Used in the results table. Provides contrast to active tab so user
			knows that different tabs can be pressed. The colour also contrasts #FEF1BF.</p>
			<p>#f2f2f2 - Light grey colour used in tables to differentiate rows. Contrast to the white rows and
			enough contrast to the black text.</p>
			<p>white - Used in header and footer text. Also is the background colour, banner image text.
			White is used to contrast #CA171C. The white background because it contrasts #CA171C in the header
			and footer and is a good colour for readability of darker text. The dark text on white background
			strains the eye less.</p>
			<p>black - Provides contrast to #FCCE14. Main text colour in the website. As the white background
			is used, black text is used to provide contrast. Black text on white background provides good
			readability. It strains the eye less.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content-wrapper">
			<h1 class="wizard-font-large">Lines, Borders and Backgrounds</h1>
			<p>
				I wanted to give the website a motion feeling because SQRL is about Quidditch and I wanted to emphasise and focus users attention to the content. I also wanted the lines, borders and backgrounds
				to link to the wizarding world.
			</p>
			<h3>Rounded elements</h3>
			<p>Used in the news images, popup text messages and team registration content. Rounded corners is
			easier to view than sharp edges. More emphasis is placed on the inside content.
			The rounded corners also provides the feeling of motion which complements the excitement
			and movement feeling in #CA171C colour. Important because Quidditch is an active sport.</p>
			<h3>Wand separator</h3>
			<p>I chose a wand separator because UK is a wizarding country so it is relatable.
			The separator provides visual cue for different information to the user. As the bacground is white,
			a separator is useful to show users when content finishes.</p>
			<h3>Positioning/Spacing and Background</h3>
			<p>The large, dominant background image in the homepage is used to grab the attention of the user.
			The large text inside the image is more focused to the user as a result.</p>
			<p>Headings and their content is placed in the centre of the page as the centre is usually the main focus.</p>
			<p>Whitespace is used to evenly space elements to provide balance. By having the content in the centre
			of the page, the left and right area has equal space.</p>
			<h3>Tables</h3>
			<p>Tables are used to present information to the user as it organises information and groups related content</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content-wrapper">
			<h1 class="wizard-font-large">Font scheme</h1>
			<p>Wizard font - Chosen to resemble fonts used by wizards as UK is a wizarding community.
			It's bold and has strong personality hence it is used for the headings and logo.</p>
			<p>SQRL default font - Used as the body font in the website because it is easier to read than the wizard
			font. This is a sans-serif font which is minimalistic therefore easier to read in smaller text and is
			better for the web.</p>
		</div>

			<h1 class="wizard-font-large">Assumptions and Limitations</h1>
			<h2>Assumptions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>User looks at the image text in homepage to find button to register page.</li>
				<li>Register page FAQ is not obtrusive and is read, only when user is stuck instead of forcing
				users to read it before filling out registrations</li>
				<li>Users want to do incomplete team registrations as well so they don't need full team but
				want to register as a team with certain people</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Limitations</h2>
			<p>Because of limited time, more effort was put on the layout, website aesthetics and consistency of the website look and feel.
			As a result, some of the website elements have basic functionality.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All the data is hard coded.</li>
				<li>I wanted to provide visual feedback before popup messages are shown to user.
				For example, while user is typing it's email, the text box can provide visual cue for valid
				and invalid email addresses. Like green outline and tick for correct email address and red outline
				and cross for incorrect email address. This visual cue provides immediate feedback compared to having to
				press the add button for response.</li>
				<li>Lack of possible scenarios during team registrations. Currently, the team registration only checks
				for valid email addresses and submission of team names during complete team registrations. If I had more time,
				more scenarios include checking for valid (currently available) team names, checking for email addresses
				which have an account at SQRL instead of just valid email addresses. Furthermore, checking if an added email
				address is already in a team or have submitted a team registrations and displaying response messages.</li>
				<li>News item and tables only show a fixed amount of data. If there was more time,
				it would have an option to view more content by moving through pages.</li>
				<li>The website is not responsive. If there was more time, the website would've been made compatible with smaller screen sizes such as mobile.</li>
